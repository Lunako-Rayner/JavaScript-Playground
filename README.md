# JavaScript Playground

## Overview

![playground](media/playgroundfinal.gif)

This project is a compilation of hands-on exercises that demonstrate key concepts in JavaScript in a visually appealing manner. The project encapsulates a dynamic array of mini-projects, each focusing on a unique aspect of JavaScript programming - from object creation and animation to DOM event manipulation. Furthermore, the project emphasizes interactive UI elements, like buttons and moving images, providing an engaging platform for immersive learning.

Built within an HTML5 Canvas environment, this project serves as a visual playground, enabling interactive learning.

## Structure

The main body of the project is contained within the files: `playground.js`, `index.html`, and `style.css`. They display the main aspects of the project, showing various JavaScript fundamentals in a visually engaging and appealing manner.

The `tutorials` directory includes a collection of sketches and practices from a course on creative coding. These files illustrate the progression of knowledge from the course, with different versions of the final sketch included for reference.

The `media` directory is split into two parts. The `media/images` directory contains images used in `playground.js`. The `media/output` directory contains images and videos created during the creative coding course, each in a separate folder corresponding to a specific date and time.

## Course Reference

The tutorials included in this project were taken from an online creative coding course. You can find the course [here](#your_course_link). I highly recommend this course for anyone looking to improve their creative coding skills.

## Preview

Here is a video of what I've created with `playground.js`:

And here are some images and videos from `media/output` created during the creative coding course:

## Conclusion

This project is a testament to the power and versatility of JavaScript. It's a compilation of my progress in learning how to manipulate HTML5 Canvas and DOM events, and serves as a great resource for anyone interested in understanding the core concepts of JavaScript.

Feel free to explore the project, and I hope it provides as much learning and inspiration for you as it has for me.
